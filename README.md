# Python-Button

This is a python button.
You need a python IDE to run the file currently hence the pyw file extention.

pyw is just a way for python to run the file without opening the terminal.
The button doesn't remember the number, it only counts the current and active session.
In a later update I hope to make a remember function for the button.
